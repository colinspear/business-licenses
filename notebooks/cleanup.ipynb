Most of them are contractors or other businesses that are likely owned and operated by a single person. I'm not really sure what I can do with these, so I will leave them out for now. There are about 1200 businesses and 5500 rows that will be dropped. The rest of these all appear in more than one year. I am going to count anything that is in the data without a `Gone Out of Business` status as operational. "

It's worth remembering that we've made a lot of assumptions here that are likely to affect our final results. We'll want to make a note of these and anything else we think might be worth experimenting with in the future to improve our model. "
