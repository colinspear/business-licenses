It's up to you as the analyst (or me in this case) to decide what is a good use of your time. **This. Is. Hard.** Always. Personally I have the attention span of a two year old, so I am always having to drag myself back to ask myself if what I am doing is likely to have a material impact on the analysis or if I am simply chasing something shiny. \n",
